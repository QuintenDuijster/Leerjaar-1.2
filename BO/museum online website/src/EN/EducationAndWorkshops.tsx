                                Sometimes, something has to happen to spark your energy, get you inspired and motivate you to take action. 
                                We believe in the power of art to have this effect.
                                It breaks through your everyday thought patterns and creates space for new perspectives.
                                And we ask the questions that count, too. The goal: a new mindset to facilitate sustainable change.
