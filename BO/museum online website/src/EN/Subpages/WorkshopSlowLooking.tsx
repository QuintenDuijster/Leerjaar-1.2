                        In this workshop, you explore a single artwork through a series of guided activities, including close looking,
                        careful listening, creative writing – and drawing. Connect your findings to bigger systems and integrate the concept into your own learning
                        and innovation process. This workshop is set up to empower anyone to take the time to look slow in a world of fast information.
